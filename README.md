# Data_Science_Job_analysis_Project
The goal of this project is to present an analysis of the recent data science related job. As we approach the end of our B.Tech degree, we want to utilize our learned skills to help us get a better understanding of the current requirements of the jobs, meanwhile help everyone prepare themselves better for their dream position.
In summary, we scraped data science related job data from major job boards, cleaned them up for modeling, statistical analysis, and visualization.
Using the data from kaggle our analysis can help people understand more about what to expect for a certain domainâ€™s data science position.
